* Installation


Haskell can be installed through [[http://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] pretty easily.
\\
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install ghc cabal-install
#+END_SRC

Extra steps that I needed to perform post install

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cabal update
cabal install ghc-mod
#+END_SRC

* Using Haskell

Haskell can be used by running the command *GHCI* which is GHC's interactive environment where Haskell expression can be interactively evaluated and programs can be interpreted.

When declaring variables on the terminal you must declare each variable/function with let.

\\
For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
let var = 2
let function x = x * 2 -- where function is the name and x its parameter
#+END_SRC

When writing on a file the extension must be .hs and there you can't use the let keyword. To load a file onto ghci you use the :load file.hs command

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
:load file.hs
var = 2
function x = x * 2
#+END_SRC
